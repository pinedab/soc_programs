##### Things to Try:

##### DAY1 #####

# 1. Calculate a table for each letter in the alphabet 
# from a-z, and count how many times each letter appears
# in alice_in_wonderland.txt (fancy word for counting
# stuff is "frequency distribution" - because you are 
# counting the frequency of something).
# a: 34,560
# b: 5,027
# ...
# z: 893
# Store the results in a list of lists:
# result = [ ["a", 34560], ["b", 5027], ... , ["z", 893] ]
# Hint: use python's lower() method isalpha() method
