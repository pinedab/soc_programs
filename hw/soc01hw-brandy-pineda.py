##### Write a program that tells you the following:

#####DAY1
# 1. Hours in a year. How many hours are in a year?
print(24 * 365)
# 2. Minutes in a decade. How many minutes are in a decade?
print((60 * 24) *365* 10)
# 3. Your age in seconds. How many seconds old are you? 
print(60*60*(24 * 365 * 21))
# 4. Andreea Visanoiu​: I'm 48618000 seconds old hahaha. Calculate @Andreea Visanoiu's age.
print(48618000 / (60*60*24*365) * 10)

#####DAY2 NONE
#####DAY3
# 5. Full name greeting. Write a program that asks for a 
# person’s first name, then middle, and then last. Finally,
# it should greet the person using their full name.
first = input("Enter first name: ")
mid = input("Enter second name: ") + ' '
last = input("Enter last name: ")
print("Nice to meet you, " + first + ' ' + mid + last)
# 6. Bigger, better favorite number. Write a program that
# asks for a person’s favorite number. Have your program 
# add 1 to the number, and then suggest the result as a 
# bigger and better favorite number. (Do be tactful 
# about it, though.)
