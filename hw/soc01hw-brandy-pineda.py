##### Write a program that tells you the following:

# 1. Hours in a year. How many hours are in a year?
# 2. Minutes in a decade. How many minutes are in a decade?
# 3. Your age in seconds. How many seconds old are you? 
# 4. Andreea Visanoiuâ€‹: I'm 48618000 seconds old hahaha. Calculate @Andreea Visanoiu's age.

##### Here are some tougher questions:

# 5. How many days does it take for a 32-bit system to timeout, if it has a bug with integer overflow?
# 6. How about a 64-bit system? Computers run on milliseconds!
# 7. Calculate your age accurately based on your birthday 
# (maybe use time of day e.g. 8:23am if you know it, use 12:00 noon midday) - you will need Python modules.
